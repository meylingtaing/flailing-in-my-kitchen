I like cooking, but whenever I take pictures of my own food it''s super ugly, mostly because I don''t know the first thing about photography, let alone food photography. But my aunt is always asking me what I''m cooking, and I want a better way to show her that I''m being a functioning adult. So I decided that I should create an Instagram and post awesome pictures of food that I make and my sister takes!\n\nAnyway, I downloaded the app on my phone, created an account, and attempted to set a username. I kept getting an error, so I decided to restart the app and login again. Then I got this message:\n\n> "Your account has been disabled for violating our terms."\n\nWHAT?! I didn''t even post a single picture! I actually attempted to restore my account (the link to do so was super hard to find by the way), to which I received an email:\n\n> "Thanks for contacting us. Before we can help, we need you to confirm that you own this account. \n\n> Please reply to this email and attach a photo of yourself holding a hand-written copy of the code below.\n\n> [Redacted]\n\n> Please make sure that the photo you send:\n\n> - Includes the above code hand-written on a clean sheet of paper, followed by your full name and username\n\n> - Includes both your hand that''s holding the sheet of paper and your entire face\n\n> - Is well-lit, and is not too small, dark or blurry\n\n> - Is attached to your reply as a JPEG file"\n\nWHAT?! Now you need my face?! This seemed suuuper sketchy to me, so I did some googling and reading about Instagram on Reddit, and yes, this is totally legit. I actually started to try and get this picture of myself taken, until I realized that I needed my username in the picture, and I wasn''t even sure if I had successfully set a username. So at that point I said "Screw this."\n\n\nYeah, I write code for a living, and yet I''m awful at technology. I should have let my little cousin create the Instagram account for me. But anyway, Plan B. I''m going to start a food blog. Food blogs are the reason I can even cook in the first place. ([Perhaps a future blog post will explain my initial foray into cooking](/entry/136)) And I love reading food blogs.\n\nNow even though I like programming, I decided that this project will mainly be focused on food, sentences, and pictures. Not code. Not system administration. I''ve created a website on my own before, but I didn''t want to deal with the overhead for this. So WordPress it is. Maybe once I have a decent amount of posts, I''ll consider moving this content into my own domain and actually make the site look less generic.\n\nOh yeah, as I was creating a WordPress site, I realized I already had one. From over 5 years ago. Since then, I stopped using Linux desktop and have switched to a Chromebook. Hopefully I actually keep up with the blog posting this time.\n\nFor now, here''s a poorly taken photograph of some tacos I made last year.\n\n![](https://cdn.meylingtaing.com/from-wordpress/2019/01/img_0308.jpg)\n','\n',char(10)),'Holy crap, I forgot I had a wordpress site',NULL,1,0);

Now I know I could just throw tuna, mayonnaise, and chopped celery in a bowl and call that a tuna salad, but that''s boring. I went to Allrecipes.com to try and find something better. I typed in "tuna salad" in the search bar, and this is the first result:\n\n> Tuna and lettuce salad with garbanzo beans, chopped egg, and cucumber. Great with French dressing.\n\n> https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21406/tuna-salad/\n\nUhh, that''s not what I call a tuna salad. That''s a "Salad with Tuna". And you know what the second result is?\n\n> Quick and easy vegetarian main dish made from pantry items in just a few minutes. Perfect for summer picnics or fast weeknight meals. Serve on bread, buns, crackers, pita bread, or plain.\n\n> https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/234227/no-tuna-salad/\n\nWHAT. That''s not a tuna salad at all! Why would you show me a vegetarian recipe as one of the top results? If I had typed "vegetarian tuna salad" then I totally get it. I even understand if it''s say, the fifth result, after other results that are traditional tuna salads. But Allrecipes needs to redo their search algorithm.\n\nSo Recipe #3 it is: [Barbie''s Tuna Salad](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/98579/barbies-tuna-salad/). What I liked about this was that it didn''t call for celery, and it did call for lots of spices. I do like celery in my tuna salad, but I don''t want to buy a huge piece of celery just to use a single stalk. Unfortunately there was no crunch at all in this recipe, so I replaced the dried minced onions with fresh diced onions. And I put waaay more than 1/8 tsp. It was at least a 1/4 cup.\n\nAs I mixed up all the ingredients, something hit me. I was missing a crucial tuna salad ingredient: hard boiled eggs! NOOOO. Why doesn''t the recipe call for hard boiled eggs?! Well, it was too late to add it since I was hungry. Next time.\n\n![Mixing tuna salad](https://cdn.meylingtaing.com/from-wordpress/2019/01/img_0326.jpg)\n\n![Tuna sandwich - open face](https://cdn.meylingtaing.com/from-wordpress/2019/01/img_0328-e1547405691209.jpg)\n\n![Tuna sandwich with burnt roll](https://cdn.meylingtaing.com/from-wordpress/2019/01/img_0329-e1547405591967.jpg)\n\nI burned the roll even though I literally stared at it the whole time it was in the toaster oven.\n\n','\n',char(10)),'Tuna Salad',NULL,1,0);

My company had their semi-annual company meetings this past week, and even though I''m pretty sure I had about 8 hours of sleep each night, I feel incredibly sleep deprived. I ate nothing but hotel and restaurant food all week, which makes my body feel really weird. I don''t know how I went most of college only eating out.\n\nAnyway, I needed to do some real cooking on Friday night. I had bacon that had been sitting in the fridge for a week, so naturally I decided to cook brussels sprouts. I actually had brussels sprouts the day before at Altius, but they were so crispy and salty I was practically eating potato chips. I decided to cook Jessica Gavin''s [Sauteed Brussels Sprouts with Bacon](https://www.jessicagavin.com/sauteed-brussels-sprouts-with-bacon-recipe/).\n\n![Sauteed brussels sprouts](https://cdn.meylingtaing.com/from-wordpress/2019/01/img_3462-e1547920416828.jpg)\n\n^ This is the first post with nicer pictures! My sister took this!\n\nI skipped the breadcrumb step out of laziness. I also doubled the amount of bacon because that''s just how much I had on hand. And I replaced shallots with red onions. Can you believe one red onion at Giant Eagle costs more than a whole bag of red onions at Aldi? I don''t even want to think about how much a shallot costs. Also onions are delicious and you can never have too many onions in your dish.\n\nBrussels sprouts aren''t exactly a meal in itself, but I didn''t want to do _that_ much cooking, so I decided to be half lazy and buy pierogies from Whole Foods. My absolute favorite pierogies are [Gosia''s Pierogies](http://www.gosiaspierogies.com/), and I used to frequently buy their frozen packs at a local farmer''s market. Every single year they''ve increased their prices, so much so that now they''re the same price as the pierogies in Whole Foods.\n\n![Pierogies and brussels sprouts](https://cdn.meylingtaing.com/from-wordpress/2019/01/img_3483.jpg)\n\n^ I almost always eat with my cheap Asian plates.\n\nThe pierogies were just OK. My sister isn''t a fan of starch inside starch, so next time we''ll go with a less traditional filling. I cut up and sauteed a whole onion to go with them, but it wasn''t enough.

I always find cooking seafood with other things to be kind of tricky, but if I cook it by itself then I can get it to just the right amount of done-ness.\n* **Fewer peas**.
